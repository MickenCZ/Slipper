# Slipper
This is a social media application similar to Twitter, in which you can see posts from others, or log in yourself and post your thoughts across all your devices, and in sync. It also allows you to comment on posts, adding more to a discussion. You can filter out posts based on whether you commented or not, making it a breeze to revisit old posts of your interests. Each posts features a date of posting, profile picture, username and number of comments, so you'll know just how important it is.
## Stack
This application is built in React, with Next.js used for the backend. While they authentication is handled purely by Clerk, the data handling and storing is taken care of by a MySQL database hosted on planetscale. Most of the project is written in typescript and it closely resembles the T3 stack, just without TRPC. In fact, the way this app was built is both similar to more traditional ways of building apps and to the new ways of serverless and an integrated FE and BE.
